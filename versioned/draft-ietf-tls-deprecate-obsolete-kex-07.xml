<t>For (D)TLS 1.2, this document deprecates the use of two key exchanges, namely Diffie-Hellman over

cipher suites.</t>
      <t>These prescriptions apply only to (D)TLS 1.2 since (D)TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are
deprecated by RFC 8996 and (D)TLS 1.3 either does not use the affected

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>(D)TLS 1.2 supports a variety of key exchange algorithms, including RSA, Diffie-Hellman
over a finite field, and elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).</t>
      <t>Diffie-Hellman key exchange, over any group, comes in ephemeral and
non-ephemeral varieties. Non-ephemeral DH algorithms use static DH public keys
included in the authenticating peer's certificate; see <xref target="RFC4492"/> for discussion.
In contrast, ephemeral DH algorithms use ephemeral DH public keys sent in the
handshake and authenticated by the peer's certificate. Ephemeral and
non-ephemeral finite field DH algorithms are called DHE and DH (or FFDHE and FFDH),
respectively, and ephemeral and non-ephemeral elliptic curve DH algorithms are called
ECDHE and ECDH, respectively <xref target="RFC4492"/>.</t>
      <t>In general, non-ephemeral cipher suites are not recommended due to their lack of
forward secrecy. Moreover, as demonstrated by the <xref target="Raccoon"/> attack on finite-field
DH, public key reuse, either via non-ephemeral cipher suites or reused keys with
ephemeral cipher suites, can lead to timing side channels that may leak connection
secrets. For elliptic curve DH, invalid curve attacks similarly exploit secret
reuse in order to break security <xref target="ICA"/>, further demonstrating the risk of reusing
public keys. While both side channels can be avoided in implementations, experience
shows that in practice, implementations may fail to thwart such attacks due to the
complexity and number of the required mitigations.</t>
      <t>Additionally, RSA key exchange suffers from security problems that are independent
of implementation choices as well as problems that stem purely from the difficulty
of implementing security countermeasures correctly.</t>
      <t>At a rough glance, the problems affecting FFDHE in (D)TLS 1.2 are as follows:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
          <t>FFDHE suffers from interoperability problems because there is no mechanism for
negotiating the group, and some implementations only support small group sizes
(see <xref target="RFC7919"/>, Section 1).</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>FFDHE groups may have small subgroups, which enables several attacks
<xref target="subgroups"/>. When presented with a custom, non-standardized FFDHE group, a handshaking client cannot practically verify that the group chosen by the server does not suffer from this problem. There is also no mechanism for such handshakes to fall back to other key exchange parameters that are acceptable to the client.
Custom FFDHE groups are widespread (as a result of advice based on <xref target="weak-dh"/>).
Therefore, clients cannot simply reject handshakes that present custom, and thus potentially dangerous, groups.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>In practice, some operators use 1024-bit FFDHE groups since this is the
maximum size that ensures wide support (see <xref target="RFC7919"/>, Section 1).
This size leaves only a small security margin vs. the current discrete log record,
which stands at 795 bits <xref target="DLOG795"/>.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Expanding on the previous point, just a handful of very large computations allow
an attacker to cheaply decrypt a relatively large fraction of FFDHE traffic
(namely, traffic encrypted using particular standardized groups) <xref target="weak-dh"/>.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>When secrets are not fully ephemeral, FFDHE suffers from the <xref target="Raccoon"/> side
channel attack. (Note that FFDH is inherently vulnerable to the Raccoon attack
unless constant-time mitigations are employed.)</t>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <t>The problems affecting RSA key exchange in (D)TLS 1.2 are as follows:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
          <t>RSA key exchange offers no forward secrecy, by construction.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>RSA key exchange may be vulnerable to Bleichenbacher's attack <xref target="BLEI"/>.
Experience shows that variants of this attack arise every few years because
implementing the relevant countermeasure correctly is difficult (see
<xref target="ROBOT"/>, <xref target="NEW-BLEI"/>, <xref target="DROWN"/>).</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>In addition to the above point, there is no convenient mechanism in (D)TLS 1.2 for
the domain separation of keys. Therefore, a single endpoint that is vulnerable to
Bleichenbacher's attack would affect all endpoints sharing the same RSA key (see
<xref target="XPROT"/>, <xref target="DROWN"/>).</t>

      <t>Non-ephemeral finite field DH cipher suites (TLS_DH_*), as well as ephemeral key reuse
for finite field DH cipher suites, are prohibited due to the <xref target="Raccoon"/> attack. Both are
already considered bad practice since they do not provide forward secrecy. However,
Raccoon revealed that timing side channels in processing TLS premaster secrets may be
exploited to reveal the encrypted premaster secret.</t>
      <t>As for non-ephemeral elliptic curve DH cipher suites (TLS_ECDH_*), forgoing forward secrecy
not only allows retroactive decryption in the event of key compromise but may
also enable a broad category of attacks where the attacker exploits key reuse
to repeatedly query a cryptographic secret.</t>
      <t>This category includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following
examples:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
          <t>Invalid curve attacks, where the attacker exploits key reuse to repeatedly
query and eventually learn the key itself. These attacks have been shown to be
practical against real-world TLS implementations <xref target="ICA"/>.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Side channel attacks, where the attacker exploits key reuse and an additional
side channel to learn a cryptographic secret. As one example of such attacks,
refer to <xref target="MAY4"/>.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>Fault attacks, where the attacker exploits key reuse and incorrect
calculations to learn a cryptographic secret. As one example of such attacks,
see <xref target="PARIS256"/>.</t>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <t>Such attacks are often implementation-dependent, including the above examples.
However, these examples demonstrate that building a system that reuses keys and
avoids this category of attacks is difficult in practice. In contrast, avoiding
key reuse not only prevents decryption in the event of key compromise, but also
precludes this category of attacks altogether. Therefore, this document
discourages the reuse of elliptic curve DH public keys.</t>
      <t>As for ephemeral finite field Diffie-Hellman in (D)TLS 1.2 (TLS_DHE_* and TLS_PSK_DHE_*), as explained above, clients have no practical way to support these cipher suites while ensuring they only negotiate security parameters that are acceptable to them. In (D)TLS 1.2, the server chooses the Diffie-Hellman group, and custom groups are prevalent. Therefore, once the client includes these cipher suites in its handshake and the server presents a custom group, the client cannot complete the handshake while ensuring security. Verifying the group structure is prohibitively expensive for the client. Using a safelist of known-good groups is also impractical, since server operators were encouraged to generate their own custom group. Further, there is no mechanism for the handshake to fall back to other parameters, that are acceptable to both the client and server.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>Traditional finite-field-based Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange during the Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake suffers from a number of security, interoperability, and efficiency shortcomings. These shortcomings arise from lack of clarity about which DH group parameters TLS servers should offer and clients should accept. This document offers a solution to these shortcomings for compatible peers by using a section of the TLS "Supported Groups Registry" (renamed from "EC Named Curve Registry" by this document) to establish common finite field DH parameters with known structure and a mechanism for peers to negotiate support for these groups.</t>
              <t>This document updates TLS versions 1.0 (RFC 2246), 1.1 (RFC 4346), and 1.2 (RFC 5246), as well as the TLS Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) extensions (RFC 4492).</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) are used to protect data exchanged over a wide range of application protocols and can also form the basis for secure transport protocols. Over the years, the industry has witnessed several serious attacks on TLS and DTLS, including attacks on the most commonly used cipher suites and their modes of operation. This document provides the latest recommendations for ensuring the security of deployed services that use TLS and DTLS. These recommendations are applicable to the majority of use cases.</t>
              <t>RFC 7525, an earlier version of the TLS recommendations, was published when the industry was transitioning to TLS 1.2. Years later, this transition is largely complete, and TLS 1.3 is widely available. This document updates the guidance given the new environment and obsoletes RFC 7525. In addition, this document updates RFCs 5288 and 6066 in view of recent attacks.</t>

              <t>This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as a Transport Layer Security (TLS) authenticated encryption operation. GCM provides both confidentiality and data origin authentication, can be efficiently implemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second and above, and is also well-suited to software implementations. This memo defines TLS cipher suites that use AES-GCM with RSA, DSA, and Diffie-Hellman-based key exchange mechanisms. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t>This document formally deprecates Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346). Accordingly, those documents have been moved to Historic status. These versions lack support for current and recommended cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms, and various government and industry profiles of applications using TLS now mandate avoiding these old TLS versions. TLS version 1.2 became the recommended version for IETF protocols in 2008 (subsequently being obsoleted by TLS version 1.3 in 2018), providing sufficient time to transition away from older versions. Removing support for older versions from implementations reduces the attack surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and streamlines library and product maintenance.</t>
              <t>This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC 4347) but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1.</t>

              <t>This document describes new key exchange algorithms based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. In particular, it specifies the use of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement in a TLS handshake and the use of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) as a new authentication mechanism. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
