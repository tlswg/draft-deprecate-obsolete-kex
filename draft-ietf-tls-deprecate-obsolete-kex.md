--- abstract

This document deprecates the use of RSA key exchange and Diffie Hellman over a finite field in TLS 1.2, and discourages the use of static elliptic curve Diffie Hellman cipher suites.

Note that these prescriptions apply only to TLS 1.2 since TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are
deprecated by RFC 8996 and TLS 1.3 either does not use the affected
algorithm or does not share the relevant configuration options.

This document updates RFCs 9325, 4346, 5246, 4162, 6347, 5932, 5288, 6209, 6367, 8422, 5289, 5469, 4785, 4279, 5487, 6655, and 7905.

# Introduction {#introduction}

TLS 1.2 supports a variety of key exchange algorithms, including RSA, Diffie Hellman
over a finite field, and elliptic curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH).

Diffie Hellman key exchange, over any group, comes in ephemeral and
non-ephemeral varieties. Non-ephemeral DH algorithms use static DH public keys
included in the authenticating peer's certificate; see {{?RFC4492}} for discussion.
In contrast, ephemeral DH algorithms use ephemeral DH public keys sent in the
handshake and authenticated by the peer's certificate. Ephemeral and
non-ephemeral finite field DH algorithms are called DHE and DH (or FFDHE and FFDH),
respectively, and ephemeral and non-ephemeral elliptic curve DH algorithms are called
ECDHE and ECDH, respectively {{?RFC4492}}.

In general, non-ephemeral cipher suites are not recommended due to their lack of
forward secrecy. Moreover, as demonstrated by the {{Raccoon}} attack on finite-field
DH, public key reuse, either via non-ephemeral cipher suites or reused keys with
ephemeral cipher suites, can lead to timing side channels that may leak connection
secrets. For elliptic curve DH, invalid curve attacks similarly exploit secret
reuse in order to break security {{ICA}}, further demonstrating the risk of reusing
public keys. While both side channels can be avoided in implementations, experience
shows that in practice, implementations may fail to thwart such attacks due to the
complexity and number of the required mitigations.

Additionally, RSA key exchange suffers from security problems that are independent
of implementation choices as well as problems that stem purely from the difficulty
of implementing security countermeasures correctly.

At a rough glance, the problems affecting FFDHE in TLS 1.2 are as follows:

1. FFDHE suffers from interoperability problems because there is no mechanism for
negotiating the group, and some implementations only support small group sizes
(see {{!RFC7919}}, Section 1).

2. FFDHE groups may have small subgroups, which enables several attacks
{{subgroups}}. When presented with a custom, non-standardized FFDHE group, a handshaking client cannot practically verify that the group chosen by the server does not suffer from this problem. There is also no mechanism for such handshakes to fall back to other key exchange parameters that are acceptable to the client.
Custom FFDHE groups are widespread (as a result of advice based on {{weak-dh}}).
Therefore, clients cannot simply reject handshakes that present custom, and thus potentially dangerous, groups.

3. In practice, some operators use 1024-bit FFDHE groups since this is the
maximum size that ensures wide support (see {{!RFC7919}}, Section 1).
This size leaves only a small security margin vs. the current discrete log record,
which stands at 795 bits {{DLOG795}}.

4. Expanding on the previous point, just a handful of very large computations allow
an attacker to cheaply decrypt a relatively large fraction of FFDHE traffic
(namely, traffic encrypted using particular standardized groups) {{weak-dh}}.

5. When secrets are not fully ephemeral, FFDHE suffers from the {{Raccoon}} side
channel attack. (Note that FFDH is inherently vulnerable to the Raccoon attack
unless constant-time mitigations are employed.)

The problems affecting RSA key exchange in TLS 1.2 are as follows:

1. RSA key exchange offers no forward secrecy, by construction.

2. RSA key exchange may be vulnerable to Bleichenbacher's attack {{BLEI}}.
Experience shows that variants of this attack arise every few years because
implementing the relevant countermeasure correctly is difficult (see
{{ROBOT}}, {{NEW-BLEI}}, {{DROWN}}).

3. In addition to the above point, there is no convenient mechanism in TLS 1.2 for
the domain separation of keys. Therefore, a single endpoint that is vulnerable to
Bleichenbacher's attack would affect all endpoints sharing the same RSA key (see
{{XPROT}}, {{DROWN}}).

This document updates {{!RFC9325}}, {{!RFC4346}}, {{!RFC5246}},
{{!RFC4162}}, {{!RFC6347}}, {{!RFC5932}}, {{!RFC5288}}, {{!RFC6209}}, {{!RFC6367}},
{{!RFC8422}}, {{!RFC5289}}, {{!RFC4785}}, {{!RFC4279}}, {{!RFC5487}}, {{!RFC6655}}, {{!RFC7905}} and {{!RFC5469}} to remediate the above problems.

{{RFC9325}} contains the latest IETF recommendations for users of the TLS protocol (and specifically, TLS 1.2) and this
document supersedes it in several points. {{update-9325}} details the exact differences.
All other recommendations of the BCP document remain valid.

## Requirements

{::boilerplate bcp14}

# Non-Ephemeral Diffie Hellman {#non-ephemeral}

Clients MUST NOT offer and servers MUST NOT select non-ephemeral FFDH cipher suites in TLS 1.2 connections.
(Note that TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are deprecated by {{!RFC8996}} and TLS 1.3 does not
support FFDH {{!I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}.) This includes all cipher suites listed in the table in
{{appendix-dh}}.

Clients SHOULD NOT offer and servers SHOULD NOT select non-ephemeral ECDH cipher suites in TLS 1.2 connections. (This requirement is already present in {{!RFC9325}}.
Note that TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are deprecated by {{!RFC8996}} and
TLS 1.3 does not support ECDH {{!I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}.) This includes all cipher suites listed
in the table in {{appendix-ecdh}}.

In addition, to avoid the use of non-ephemeral Diffie Hellman, clients SHOULD NOT use and servers SHOULD NOT accept certificates with fixed DH parameters. These certificate types are rsa_fixed_dh, dss_fixed_dh, rsa_fixed_ecdh and ecdsa_fixed_ecdh as listed in {{appendix-cert}}. These values only apply to TLS versions of 1.2 and below.

# Ephemeral Finite Field Diffie Hellman {#dhe}

Clients MUST NOT offer and servers MUST NOT select FFDHE cipher suites in TLS 1.2 connections.
This includes all cipher suites listed in the table in {{appendix-dhe}}.
(Note that TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are deprecated by {{!RFC8996}}.) FFDHE cipher suites in TLS 1.3 do not suffer from the problems presented in {{introduction}}; see {{!I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}. Therefore, clients and servers MAY offer FFDHE cipher suites in TLS 1.3 connections.

# RSA {#rsa}

Clients MUST NOT offer and servers MUST NOT select RSA cipher suites in TLS 1.2
connections. (Note that TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are deprecated by {{!RFC8996}}, and TLS
1.3 does not support static RSA {{!I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis}}.) This includes all cipher suites
listed in the table in {{appendix-rsa}}. Note that these cipher suites are
already marked as not recommended in the "TLS Cipher Suites" registry.

# IANA Considerations

This document requests IANA to mark the cipher suites from the "TLS Cipher Suites" registry listed in {{appendix-dh}}, {{appendix-ecdh}}, {{appendix-dhe}}, {{appendix-rsa}}, and the certificate types from the "TLS ClientCertificateType Identifiers" registry listed in {{appendix-cert}} as "D" in the "Recommended" column, see {{!I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8447bis}}.

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

Non-ephemeral finite field DH cipher suites (TLS_DH_\*), as well as ephemeral key reuse
for finite field DH cipher suites, are prohibited due to the {{Raccoon}} attack. Both are
already considered bad practice since they do not provide forward secrecy. However,
Raccoon revealed that timing side channels in processing TLS premaster secrets may be
exploited to reveal the encrypted premaster secret.

As for non-ephemeral elliptic curve DH cipher suites (TLS_ECDH_\*), forgoing forward secrecy
not only allows retroactive decryption in the event of key compromise but may
also enable a broad category of attacks where the attacker exploits key reuse
to repeatedly query a cryptographic secret.

This category includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following
examples:

1. Invalid curve attacks, where the attacker exploits key reuse to repeatedly
query and eventually learn the key itself. These attacks have been shown to be
practical against real-world TLS implementations {{ICA}}.

2. Side channel attacks, where the attacker exploits key reuse and an additional
side channel to learn a cryptographic secret. As one example of such attacks,
refer to {{MAY4}}.

3. Fault attacks, where the attacker exploits key reuse and incorrect
calculations to learn a cryptographic secret. As one example of such attacks,
see {{PARIS256}}.

Such attacks are often implementation-dependent, including the above examples.
However, these examples demonstrate that building a system that reuses keys and
avoids this category of attacks is difficult in practice. In contrast, avoiding
key reuse not only prevents decryption in the event of key compromise, but also
precludes this category of attacks altogether. Therefore, this document
discourages the reuse of elliptic curve DH public keys.

As for ephemeral finite field Diffie-Hellman in TLS 1.2 (TLS_DHE_\* and TLS_PSK_DHE_\*), as explained above, clients have no practical way to support these cipher suites while ensuring they only negotiate security parameters that are acceptable to them. In TLS 1.2, the server chooses the Diffie-Hellman group, and custom groups are prevalent. Therefore, once the client includes these cipher suites in its handshake and the server presents a custom group, the client cannot complete the handshake while ensuring security. Verifying the group structure is prohibitively expensive for the client. Using a safelist of known-good groups is also impractical, since server operators were encouraged to generate their own custom group. Further, there is no mechanism for the handshake to fall back to other parameters, that are acceptable to both the client and server.
